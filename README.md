# CREDIT-CARD-APPROVAL-PREDICTION
Introduction
The entire banking sector relies on the practice of borrowing and lending. Banks borrow money from depositors and other sources and lend that money to borrowers who need it.

During the lending process, banks carry out credit analysis to evaluate the creditworthiness of a borrower which helps in risk assessment and getting an overall view of the applicant's financial standing by analyzing the credit history. It also helps in maintaining profitability, minimizing the risk of fraudulent activities, and enhancing the customer experience.

Predicting good clients is important for banks in today's world because it can help them to:

Reduce risk: Banks can use predictive models to identify customers who are more likely to default on their loans or credit cards. This can help banks to reduce their risk of losses. Increase profitability: Banks can use predictive models to identify customers who are more likely to be profitable. This can help banks to increase their revenue and profits. Improve customer satisfaction: Banks can use predictive models to offer customers the products and services that they are most likely to need and use. This can help to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Overview of the dataset
We will work on Credit_card.csv dataset which contains 18 features and 1548 observations. Each observation contains personal, financial, and employment data of an individual. The target variable is binary and is stored in Credit_card_label.csv file.

Data Analysis Approach
Approach to Prove or Disprove Hypotheses: Steps include EDA, feature engineering, visualization, and statistical analysis. Identifying Important Patterns Using EDA: Detect missing values, outliers, and feature importance. Feature Engineering Techniques: Encoding categorical variables and standardization. Justification of Data Analysis Approach: EDA enhances data understanding, feature engineering improves data quality, visualization communicates findings effectively.
